title: "Aerosol pH Dynamics During Haze Periods in an Urban Environment in China: Use of Detailed, Hourly, Speciated Observations to Study the Role of Ammonia Availability and Secondary Aerosol Formation and Urban Environment"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/aerosol_ph_dynamics
excerpt: 'In this study, we found high acidy (pH < 3), light pollution (total water soluble ions < 30 μg/m3), and low water content (less than 5 μg/m3) were more correlated with higher rates of sulfate formation than nitrate formation in the winter.'
