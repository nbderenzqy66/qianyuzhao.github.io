excerpt: 'This paper is about gas-particle partitioning of ammonia in the inorganic aerosols. It is the first time that we created the joint source-NH3/HNO3 maps to integrate sources, aerosol pH and liquid water content, and ions (altogether in one map), which can provide useful information for designing effective strategies to control particulate matter pollution.'

This paper is about gas-particle partitioning of ammonia in the inorganic aerosols. It is the first time that we created the joint source-NH3/HNO3 maps to integrate sources, aerosol pH and liquid water content, and ions (altogether in one map), which can provide useful information for designing effective strategies to control particulate matter pollution.
