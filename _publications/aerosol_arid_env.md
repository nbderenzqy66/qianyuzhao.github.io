title: "Aerosols in an arid environment: The role of aerosol water content, particulate acidity, precursors, and relative humidity on secondary inorganic aerosols"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/aerosol_arid_env
excerpt: 'This study demonstrated that aerosol water content and particulate acidity were positively associated with secondary SO4, while NO2 and RH had a significant impact on secondary NO3 in an arid atmosphere. The findings explain the relationship between gaseous precursors, relative humidity, aerosol pH and temperature in the arid city of Hohhot.'
