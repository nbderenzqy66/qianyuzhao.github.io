I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am dedicated to advancing research in the fields of hydrology, water quality modeling, machine learning, and statistical model applications for environmental data.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Master's degree from the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University. Under the guidance of Prof. Mark Borsuk, I conducted research on aboveground tank detection using high-resolution imagery, which culminated in my thesis.

Before pursuing my Master's degree, I completed my Bachelor's degree at Nankai University. As an undergraduate, I had the privilege of working in the atmospheric group led by Prof. Guoliang Shi, focusing on the investigation of inorganic aerosols.

My passion for research is driven by the potential to develop innovative solutions that address pressing environmental and health challenges. By leveraging advanced computational techniques and data-driven approaches, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the scientific community and society at large.
