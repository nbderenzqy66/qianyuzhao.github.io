I received my Master's degree from the Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Mark Borsuk. My thesis was about Aboveground tank detection from high-resolution imagery. 

Prior to my master, I received my Bachelor's degree from Nankai University. I worked in the atmospheric group to investigate inorganic aerosols, advised by Prof. Guoliang Shi. 

My research interests are in air quality, atmospheric modeling, machine learning and statistical models applications in environmental, medical, remote sensing data.
